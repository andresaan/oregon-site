                        <h4>Geographical Location:</h4>
                        <p>Oregon is a state located in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It is bordered by Washington to the north, 
                            Idaho to the east, Nevada and California to the south, and the Pacific Ocean to the west. The state is characterized by 
                            its diverse landscapes, including coastline, mountains, forests, and high desert regions.

                        <h4>Indigenous Peoples and Displacement:</h4>
                        <p>Colonization has a profound impact to the rich array of Indigenous cultures and communities that call Oregon home. The original 
                            inhabitants include various tribes such as the Chinook, Kalapuya, Umatilla, Nez Perce, and many others. 
                            The arrival of European settlers in the 19th century led to the displacement, dispossession, and forced relocation
                            of these Indigenous peoples from their ancestral lands. The Oregon Trail, which brought waves of pioneers westward, 
                            had a profound impact on these communities, often resulting in conflicts, disease, and loss of traditional ways of life.
                        </p>
                        <p>Although Indigenous peoples of the United States still struggle with colonization and cultural erasure, they are still 
                            here trying to gain access to their ancestral land. Click learn more to find information regarding the idigenous

                            towns. The state is also known for its extensive network of hiking trails, waterfalls, and opportunities for camping,
